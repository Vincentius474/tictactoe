# TICTACTOE
# A PLAYER VS COMPUTER GAME

Ever heard of Min-Max algorithm, is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory. It is particularly used in zero--sum games,
these are games where one player's victory is the other player's defeat. The algorithm helps take the best possible action,
assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.

Min-Max algorithm has to major role players:
  1. Max Player - aims to maximize their score
  2. Min Player - aims to minimize Max's score
     
The algorithm alternates between these two players at each level of the tree
  - Max will choose the moves that gives the highest possible score
  - Min will choose the move that gives the lowest possible score

# THIS IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF MIN-MAX ALGORITHM IN TICTACTOE
